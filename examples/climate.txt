The resolution is "What is an acceptable human toll for meeting the IPC 1.5 degree warming threshold?";
The rules of engagement are "Each speaker presents their arguments and evidence, then allows the other speaker to refute their claims and ask questions.";

"Speaker_A" argues that "There is no acceptable human toll" by presenting the premise(s) "Human life is inherently valuable, and any avoidable loss of life should be prevented" and the evidence "Case studies of climate-related disasters and their impacts on human populations, ethical frameworks valuing human life";
"Speaker_B" refutes "There is no acceptable human toll" by challenging the premise(s) "Human life is inherently valuable" and presenting counter-evidence "Potential benefits of meeting the 1.5-degree warming threshold, such as preserving ecosystems and preventing long-term harm to human populations";
"Speaker_B" asks "How can we balance the immediate human toll with the long-term consequences of climate change?";
"Speaker_A" argues that "We must prioritize both immediate and long-term impacts" by presenting the premise(s) "Climate change mitigation measures should be designed to minimize human suffering while addressing the root causes of warming" and the evidence "Examples of climate policies that protect vulnerable populations, the importance of global cooperation in addressing climate change";
"Speaker_B" refutes "We must prioritize both immediate and long-term impacts" by challenging the premise(s) "Climate change mitigation measures should be designed to minimize human suffering" and presenting counter-evidence "Economic and social trade-offs in climate policy, the potential for future technological advancements to address climate change without immediate sacrifices";
"Speaker_A" asks "Can we rely on future technological advancements to the detriment of current populations?";
"Speaker_B" argues that "Technological advancements can play a significant role in climate change mitigation" by presenting the premise(s) "History has shown that technological advancements can lead to unforeseen solutions to complex problems" and the evidence "Examples of technological advancements in renewable energy, carbon capture, and geoengineering";
"Speaker_A" refutes "Technological advancements can play a significant role in climate change mitigation" by challenging the premise(s) "History has shown that technological advancements can lead to unforeseen solutions" and presenting counter-evidence "The limitations of technology in addressing systemic issues, the potential for unintended consequences";
"Speaker_A" comments on the debate process by "emphasizing the need for compassion and empathy in discussions of human toll and climate change.";
"Speaker_B" comments on the debate process by "acknowledging the importance of considering both short-term and long-term impacts when discussing climate policy.";
