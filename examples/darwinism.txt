The resolution is "Darwinism vs. Lamarckism: Which theory better explains the mechanism of evolution?";
The rules of engagement are "Each speaker presents their arguments and evidence, then allows the other speaker to refute their claims and ask questions.";

"Speaker_A" argues that "Darwinism is the more accurate explanation" by presenting the premise(s) "Natural selection drives evolution, and genetic variation arises from random mutations" and the evidence "Fossil records, molecular biology, and comparative anatomy";
"Speaker_B" refutes "Darwinism" by challenging the premise(s) "genetic variation arises from random mutations" and presenting counter-evidence "Lamarck's theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics";
"Speaker_B" asks "How does Darwinism account for rapid adaptations within a single generation?";
"Speaker_A" argues that "Epigenetics doesn't negate the role of natural selection and genetic variation in long-term evolution." by presenting the premise(s) "Epigenetic changes can be temporary and don't necessarily alter the genetic code" and the evidence "Studies on epigenetic inheritance, the role of gene-environment interactions in evolution";
"Speaker_B" refutes "Epigenetics doesn't negate the role of natural selection and genetic variation in long-term evolution." by challenging the premise(s) "Epigenetic changes can be temporary" and presenting counter-evidence "Cases of stable epigenetic inheritance across generations";
"Speaker_A" asks "Can Lamarckism explain the observed patterns of speciation and extinction in the fossil record?";
"Speaker_B" argues that "Lamarckism can account for speciation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics and environmental pressures" by presenting the premise(s) "Organisms can adapt more rapidly through Lamarckian mechanisms, leading to speciation" and the evidence "Examples of rapid adaptation in response to environmental changes, potential role of epigenetics in speciation";
"Speaker_A" comments on the debate process by "reminding that both theories should be considered in light of the available evidence and not treated as mutually exclusive.";
"Speaker_B" argues that "Lamarckism provides a more comprehensive explanation" by presenting the premise(s) "Inheritance of acquired characteristics and use and disuse of organs drive evolution" and the evidence "Giraffe's long necks and the disappearance of unused organs";
"Speaker_A" refutes "Lamarckism" by challenging the premise(s) "Inheritance of acquired characteristics" and presenting counter-evidence "Experiments showing that acquired traits are not generally inherited.";
"Speaker_A" comments on the debate process by "highlighting the importance of empirical evidence and scientific consensus in evaluating competing theories.";
