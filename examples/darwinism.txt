The resolution is "Darwinism vs. Lamarckism: Which theory better explains the mechanism of evolution?";
The rules of engagement are "Each speaker will present their arguments in favor of their chosen theory", "Refutations and questions are allowed after each argument", "Each speaker will have a chance to synthesize the arguments at the end of the debate";
"Speaker1" as "Darwinist" argues that "Darwinism is the superior explanation for the mechanism of evolution" by presenting the premise(s) "Natural selection is the driving force behind evolution", "Genetic mutations occur randomly and are inherited by offspring" and the evidence "Fossil records show gradual change in species over time", "Genetic studies confirm the role of natural selection in evolution";
"Speaker2" as "Lamarckist" argues that "Lamarckism provides a more accurate account of the mechanism of evolution" by presenting the premise(s) "Organisms can pass on acquired traits to their offspring", "Environmental changes drive the evolution of species" and the evidence "Giraffe's long necks developed as a result of stretching to reach higher leaves", "The inheritance of acquired traits has been observed in bacteria";
"Speaker1" refutes "Lamarckism provides a more accurate account of the mechanism of evolution" by challenging the premise(s) "Organisms can pass on acquired traits to their offspring", "Environmental changes drive the evolution of species" and presenting counter-evidence "Experiments have shown that acquired traits are not generally passed on to offspring", "Natural selection provides a more comprehensive explanation for adaptation to environmental changes";
"Speaker2" asks "How does Darwinism account for rapid evolutionary changes observed in some species?";
"Speaker1" presents the hypothesis "Punctuated equilibrium" to explain "the rapid evolutionary changes observed in some species";
"Speaker2" refutes "Darwinism is the superior explanation for the mechanism of evolution" by challenging the premise(s) "Genetic mutations occur randomly and are inherited by offspring" and presenting counter-evidence "Epigenetic inheritance has been demonstrated in some organisms, pointing to a possible Lamarckian influence";
"Speaker1" synthesizes "Darwinism is the superior explanation for the mechanism of evolution" and "Epigenetic inheritance has been demonstrated in some organisms, pointing to a possible Lamarckian influence" to form "Modern evolutionary synthesis could integrate aspects of both Darwinism and Lamarckism, but Darwinism remains the dominant theory";
"Speaker2" comments on the debate process by "Acknowledging the importance of considering multiple perspectives in the pursuit of scientific truth";
